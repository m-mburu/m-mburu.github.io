# Creating an igraph object

Here you will learn how to create an igraph 'object' from data stored in an edgelist. The data are friendships in a group of students. You will also learn how to make a basic visualization of the network.

Each row of the friends dataframe represents an edge in the network.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(igraph)
library(knitr)
friends <- fread("friends.csv")

```

```{r, fig.width= 10, fig.height= 10}

# Inspect the first few rows of the dataframe 'friends'
head(friends) %>% kable

# Convert friends dataframe to a matrix
friends.mat <- as.matrix(friends)

# Convert friends matrix to an igraph object
g <- graph.edgelist(friends.mat, directed = FALSE)


# Make a very basic plot of the network
plot(g)


```


# Counting vertices and edges
A lot of basic information about a network 
can be extracted from an igraph object. In this exercise
you will learn how to count the vertices and edges
from a network by applying several functions to the graph object g.
Each row of the friends dataframe represents an edge in the network.

```{r}

# Subset vertices and edges
V(g)
E(g)

# Count number of edges
gsize(g)

# Count number of vertices
gorder(g)


```


# Node attributes and subsetting

In this exercise you will learn how to add attributes to vertices in the network and view them.

```{r}

genders <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "M",
             "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "F", 
             "M", "F", "M", "M")

ages <- c("18", "19", "21", "20", "22", 
          "18", "23", "21", "22", "20",
          "20", "22", "21", "18", "19",
          "20") %>% as.numeric()



# Inspect the objects 'genders' and 'ages'
 genders
ages

# Create new vertex attribute called 'gender'
g <- set_vertex_attr(g, "gender", value = genders)

# Create new vertex attribute called 'age'
g <- set_vertex_attr(g, "age", value = ages)

# View all vertex attributes in a list
vertex_attr(g)

# View attributes of first five vertices in a dataframe
V(g)[[1:5]] 

```


# Edge attributes and subsetting
In this exercise you will learn how to add attributes 
to edges in the network and view them. For instance, 
we will add the attribute 'hours' that represents how 
many hours per week each pair of friends spend with each other.


```{r}
hours <- c("1", "2", "2", "1", "2", "5",
           "5", "1", "1", "3", "2", "1", "1",
           "5", "1", "2", "4", "1", "3", "1",
           "1", "1", "4", "1", "3", "3", "4") %>% as.numeric()


# View hours
hours

# Create new edge attribute called 'hours'
g <- set_edge_attr(g, "hours", value = hours)

# View edge attributes of graph object
edge_attr(g)

# Find all edges that include "Britt"
E(g)[[inc('Britt')]]  

# Find all pairs that spend 4 or more hours together per week
E(g)[[hours>= 4]]  
```


# Visualizing attributes

In this exercise we will learn how to create igraph
objects with attributes directly from dataframes and
how to visualize attributes in plots. We will use a 
second network of friendship connections between students.


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
friends1_edges <- read_csv("friends1_edges.csv")
friends1_nodes <- read_csv("friends1_nodes.csv")
# Create an igraph object with attributes directly from dataframes
g1 <- graph_from_data_frame(d = friends1_edges, 
                            vertices = friends1_nodes, 
                            directed = FALSE)


# Subset edges greater than or equal to 5 hours
E(g1)[[hours>=5]]  

# Set vertex color by gender
V(g1)$color <- ifelse(V(g1)$gender == "F", "orange", "dodgerblue")

# Plot the graph
plot(g1, vertex.label.color = "black")
```
# Quiz on attributes
- What term is typically used to describe the relative strength of edges?
- weight


# Igraph network layouts

The igraph package provides several built in layout algorithms for network visualization. Depending upon the size of a given network different layouts may be more effective in communicating the structure of the network. Ideally the best layout is the one that minimizes the number of edges that cross each other in the network. In this exercise you will explore just a few of the many default layout algorithms. Re-executing the code for each plot will lead to a slightly different version of the same layout type. Doing this a few times can help to find the best looking visualization for your network.


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
library(igraph)

# Plot the graph object g1 in a circle layout
plot(g1, vertex.label.color = "black", layout = layout_in_circle(g1))

# Plot the graph object g1 in a Fruchterman-Reingold layout 
plot(g1, vertex.label.color = "black", layout = layout_with_fr(g1))

# Plot the graph object g1 in a Tree layout 
m <- layout_as_tree(g1)
plot(g1, vertex.label.color = "black", layout = m)

# Plot the graph object g1 using igraph's chosen layout 
m1 <- layout_nicely(g1)
plot(g1, vertex.label.color = "black", layout = m1)

```



# Visualizing edges
In this exercise you will learn how to change the size of edges in a network based on their weight, as well as how to remove edges from a network which can sometimes be helpful in more effectively visualizing large and highly clustered networks. In this introductory chapter, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible in visualizing igraph networks. You will continue to develop these skills in future chapters.


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

# Create a vector of weights based on the number of hours each pair spend together
w1 <- E(g1)$hours

# Plot the network varying edges by weights
m1 <- layout_nicely(g1)
plot(g1, 
        vertex.label.color = "black", 
        edge.color = 'black',
        edge.width = w1,
        layout = m1)


# Create a new igraph object by deleting edges that are less than 2 hours long 
g2 <- delete_edges(g1, E(g1)[hours < 2])


# Plot the new graph 
w2 <- E(g2)$hours
m2 <- layout_nicely(g2)

plot(g2, 
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     edge.color = 'black',
     edge.width = w2,
     layout = m2)
```



# Directed igraph objects

In this exercise you will learn how to create a directed graph from a dataframe, how to inspect whether a graph object is directed and/or weighted and how to extract those vertices at the beginning and end of directed edges.

```{r}

measles <- fread("measles.csv")
# Get the graph object
g <- graph_from_data_frame(measles, directed = TRUE)

# is the graph directed?
is.directed(g)

# Is the graph weighted?
is.weighted(g)

# Where does each edge originate from?
table(head_of(g, E(g)))
```

# Identifying edges for each vertex
In this exercise you will learn how to identify particular edges. 
You will learn how to determine if an edge exists between two 
vertices as well as finding all vertices connected in either
direction to a given vertex.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}

# Make a basic plot
plot(g, 
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     edge.color = 'gray77',
     vertex.size = 0,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.1,
     layout = layout_nicely(g))

# Is there an edge going from vertex 184 to vertex 178?
g['184', '178']

# Is there an edge going from vertex 178 to vertex 184?
g['178', '184']

# Show all edges going to or from vertex 184
incident(g, '184', mode = c("all"))

# Show all edges going out from vertex 184
incident(g, '184', mode = c("out"))
```


## Neighbors

Often in network analysis it is important to explore the patterning 
of connections that exist between vertices. One way is to identify
neighboring vertices of each vertex. You can then determine which 
neighboring vertices are shared even by unconnected vertices indicating
how two vertices may have an indirect relationship through others.
In this exercise you will learn how to identify neighbors and shared
neighbors between pairs of vertices.


```{r}

# Identify all neighbors of vertex 12 regardless of direction
neighbors(g, '12', mode = c('all'))

# Identify other vertices that direct edges towards vertex 12
neighbors(g, '12', mode = c('in'))

# Identify any vertices that receive an edge from vertex 42 and direct an edge to vertex 124
n1 <-neighbors(g, '42', mode = c('out'))
n2 <- neighbors(g, '124', mode = c('in'))
intersection(n1, n2)
```



# Distances between vertices

The inter-connectivity of a network can be assessed by examining
the number and length of paths between vertices. A path is simply
the chain of connections between vertices. The number of intervening
edges between two vertices represents the geodesic distance between vertices.
Vertices that are connected to each other have a geodesic distance of 1.
Those that share a neighbor in common but are not connected to each other 
have a geodesic distance of 2 and so on. In directed networks, the direction
of edges can be taken into account. If two vertices cannot be reached via 
following directed edges they are given a geodesic distance of infinity. 
In this exercise you will learn how to find the longest paths between 
vertices in a network and how to discern those vertices that are within
n connections of a given vertex. For disease transmission networks such
as the measles dataset this helps you to identify how quickly the 
disease spreads through the network.


```{r}

# Which two vertices are the furthest apart in the graph ?
farthest_vertices(g) 

# Shows the path sequence between two furthest apart vertices.
get_diameter(g)  

# Identify vertices that are reachable within two connections from vertex 42
ego(g, 2, '42', mode = c('out'))

# Identify vertices that can reach vertex 42 within two connections
ego(g, 2, '42', mode = c('in'))
```


## Finding longest path between two vertices
- What is the longest possible path in a network referred to as?
* Diameter


# Identifying key vertices

Perhaps the most straightforward measure of vertex importance
is the degree of a vertex. The out-degree of a vertex is the number
of other individuals to which a vertex has an outgoing edge directed
to. The in-degree is the number of edges received from other individuals. 
In the measles network, individuals that infect many other individuals
will have a high out-degree. In this exercise you will identify whether
individuals infect equivalent amount of other children or if there are
key children who have high out-degrees and infect many other children.


```{r}

# Calculate the out-degree of each vertex
g.outd <- degree(g, mode = c("out"))

# View a summary of out-degree
table(g.outd)

# Make a histogram of out-degrees
hist(g.outd, breaks = 30)

# Find the vertex that has the maximum out-degree
which.max(g.outd)
```


# Betweenness

Another measure of the importance of a given vertex is its betweenness.
This is an index of how frequently the vertex lies on shortest paths 
between any two vertices in the network. It can be thought of as how 
critical the vertex is to the flow of information through a network.
Individuals with high betweenness are key bridges between different 
parts of a network. In our measles transmission network, vertices with 
high betweenness are those children who were central to passing on 
the disease to other parts of the network. In this exercise, you will
identify the betweenness score for each vertex and then make a new plot 
of the network adjusting the vertex size by its betweenness score to
highlight these key vertices.


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}

# Calculate betweenness of each vertex
g.b <- betweenness(g, directed = TRUE)

# Show histogram of vertex betweenness
hist(g.b, breaks = 80)

# Create plot with vertex size determined by betweenness score
plot(g, 
     vertex.label = NA,
     edge.color = 'black',
     vertex.size = sqrt(g.b)+1,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.05,
     layout = layout_nicely(g))
```



# Visualizing important nodes and edges

One issue with the measles dataset is that there are three 
individuals for whom no information is known about who infected them.
One of these individuals (vertex 184) appears ultimately responsible
for spreading the disease to many other individuals even though they
did not directly infect too many individuals. However, because vertex
184 has no incoming edge in the network they appear to have low 
betweenness. One way to explore the importance of this vertex is 
by visualizing the geodesic distances of connections going out 
from this individual. In this exercise you shall create a plot 
of these distances from this patient zero.


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# Make an ego graph
g184 <- make_ego_graph(g, diameter(g), nodes = '184', mode = c("all"))[[1]]

# Get a vector of geodesic distances of all vertices from vertex 184 
dists <- distances(g184, "184")

# Create a color palette of length equal to the maximal geodesic distance plus one.
colors <- c("black", "red", "orange", "blue", "dodgerblue", "cyan")

# Set color attribute to vertices of network g184.
V(g184)$color <- colors[dists+1]

# Visualize the network based on geodesic distance from vertex 184 (patient zero).
plot(g184, 
     vertex.label = dists, 
     vertex.label.color = "white",
     vertex.label.cex = .6,
     edge.color = 'black',
     vertex.size = 7,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     main = "Geodesic Distances from Patient Zero"
     )
```


- Which measure of a vertex importance is determined by how often that vertex lies on the shortest path between any two vertices in a network?

* Betweenness


# Forrest Gump network

In this chapter you will use a social network based on
the movie Forrest Gump. Each edge of the network indicates
that those two characters were in at least one scene of the
movie together. Therefore this network is undirected. 
To familiarize yourself with the network, you will first
create the network object from the raw dataset. Then,
you will identify key vertices using a measure called 
eigenvector centrality. Individuals with high eigenvector
centrality are those that are highly connected to other
highly connected individuals. You will then make an
exploratory visualization of the network.



```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

gump <- fread("gump.csv")
# Inspect Forrest Gump Movie dataset
head(gump) %>% kable()

# Make an undirected network
g <- graph_from_data_frame(gump, directed = FALSE)

# Identify key nodes using eigenvector centrality
g.ec <- eigen_centrality(g)
which.max(g.ec$vector)

# Plot Forrest Gump Network
plot(g,
vertex.label.color = "black", 
vertex.label.cex = 0.6,
vertex.size = 25*(g.ec$vector),
edge.color = 'gray88',
main = "Forrest Gump Network"
)

```



## Network density and average path length

The first graph level metric you will explore is the density of a graph. 
This is essentially the proportion of all potential edges between vertices 
that actually exist in the network graph. It is an indicator of how well 
connected the vertices of the graph are.

Another measure of how interconnected a network is average path length. 
This is calculated by determining the mean of the lengths of the shortest
paths between all pairs of vertices in the network. The longest path
length between any pair of vertices is called the diameter of the 
network graph. You will calculate the diameter and average path 
length of the original graph g.


```{r}

# Get density of a graph
gd <- edge_density(g)

# Get the diameter of the graph g
diameter(g, directed = FALSE)

# Get the average path length of the graph g
g.apl <- mean_distance(g, directed = FALSE)
g.apl


```


- If a graph has 7 vertices there are 21 possible edges in the network.
If 14 edges exist, what is the density of the network?

- 0.67


# Random graphs

Generating random graphs is an important method for investigating 
how likely or unlikely other network metrics are likely to occur 
given certain properties of the original graph. The simplest random 
graph is one that has the same number of vertices as your original 
graph and approximately the same density as the original graph. 
Here you will create one random graph that is based on the original
Forrest Gump Network.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=15}

# Create one random graph with the same number of nodes and edges as g
g.random <- erdos.renyi.game(n = gorder(g), p.or.m = gd, type = "gnp")

g.random

plot(g.random)

# Get density of new random graph `g.random`
edge_density(g.random)

#Get the average path length of the random graph g.random
mean_distance(g.random, directed = FALSE)

```


# Network randomizations

In the previous exercise you may have noticed that the average path 
length of the Forrest Gump network was smaller than the average path
length of the random network. If you ran the code a few times you will
have noticed that it is nearly always lower in the Forrest Gump network
than the random network. What this suggests is that the Forrest Gump 
network is more highly interconnected than each random network even 
though the random networks have the same number of vertices and approximately
identical graph densities. Rather than re-running this code many times,
you can more formally address this by creating 1000 random graphs based
on the number of vertices and density of the original Forrest Gump graph.
Then, you can see how many times the average path length of the random
graphs is less than the original Forrest Gump network. This is called a 
randomization test.

The graph g, and its average path length (that you calculated in the
previous exercise), g.apl are in your workspace.

```{r}

# Generate 1000 random graphs
gl <- vector('list', 1000)
  
for(i in 1:1000){
  gl[[i]] <- erdos.renyi.game(n = gorder(g), p.or.m = gd, type = "gnp")
}

# Calculate average path length of 1000 random graphs
gl.apls <- unlist(lapply(gl, mean_distance, directed = FALSE))

# Plot the distribution of average path lengths
hist(gl.apls, xlim = range(c(1.5, 6)))
abline(v = mean(gl.apls), col = "red", lty = 3, lwd = 2)

# Calculate the proportion of graphs with an average path length lower than our observed
mean(gl.apls  < g.apl)

```



## Randomization quiz
- Randomization tests enable you to identify:
* Whether features of your original network are particularly unusual.



# Triangles and transitivity

Another important measure of local connectivity in a network graph 
involves investigating triangles (also known as triads). In this 
exercise you will find all closed triangles that exist in a network. 
This means that an edge exists between three given vertices. You can 
then calculate the transitivity of the network. This is equivalent to
the proportion of all possible triangles in the network that are closed.
You will also learn how to identify the number of closed triangles that
any given vertex is a part of and its local transitivity - that is, 
the proportion of closed triangles that the vertex is a part of 
given the theoretical number of triangles it could be a part of.


```{r}

# Show all triangles in the network.
#matrix(triangles(g), nrow = 3)

# Count the number of triangles that vertex "BUBBA" is in.
count_triangles(g, vids='BUBBA')

# Calculate  the global transitivity of the network.
g.tr <- transitivity(g)
g.tr

# Calculate the local transitivity for vertex BUBBA.
transitivity(g, vids='BUBBA', type = "local")

```


# Transitivity randomizations

As you did for the average path length, let's investigate
if the global transitivity of the Forrest Gump network is
significantly higher than we would expect by chance for
random networks of the same size and density. You can compare
Forrest Gump's global transitivity to 1000 other random networks.

```{r}


# Calculate average transitivity of 1000 random graphs
gl.tr <- lapply(gl, transitivity)
gl.trs <- unlist(gl.tr)

# Get summary statistics of transitivity scores
summary(gl.trs)

# Calculate the proportion of graphs with a transitivity score higher than Forrest Gump's network
mean(gl.trs > g.tr)
```


# Cliques
Identifying cliques is a common practice in undirected networks. 
In a clique every two unique nodes are adjacent - that means that 
every individual node is connected to every other individual node 
in the clique. In this exercise you will identify the largest cliques 
in the Forrest Gump network. You will also identify the number of 
maximal cliques of various sizes. A clique is maximal if it cannot
be extended to a larger clique.

```{r}

# Identify the largest cliques in the network
largest_cliques(g)

# Determine all maximal cliques in the network and assign to object 'clq'
clq <- max_cliques(g)

# Calculate the size of each maximal clique.
table(unlist(lapply(clq, length)))

```



# Visualize largest cliques

Often in network visualization you will need to subset part
of a network to inspect the inter-connections of particular vertices. 
Here, you will create a visualization of the largest cliques in the
Forrest Gump network. In the last exercise you determined that there
were two cliques of size 9. You will plot these side-by-side after 
creating two new igraph objects by subsetting out these cliques 
from the main network. The function subgraph() enables you to choose
which vertices to keep in a new network object.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
library(igraph)

# Assign largest cliques output to object 'lc'
lc <- largest_cliques(g)

# Create two new undirected subgraphs, each containing only the vertices of each largest clique.
gs1 <- as.undirected(subgraph(g, lc[[1]]))
gs2 <- as.undirected(subgraph(g, lc[[2]]))


# Plot the two largest cliques side-by-side

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # To plot two plots side-by-side

plot(gs1,
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.9,
     vertex.size = 0,
     edge.color = 'gray28',
     main = "Largest Clique 1",
     layout = layout.circle(gs1)
)

plot(gs2,
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.9,
     vertex.size = 0,
     edge.color = 'gray28',
     main = "Largest Clique 2",
     layout = layout.circle(gs2)
)

```


# Assortativity

In this exercise you will determine the assortativity() of the second 
friendship network from the first chapter. This is a measure of how 
preferentially attached vertices are to other vertices with identical 
attributes. You will also determine the degree assortativity which 
determines how preferentially attached are vertices to other vertices
of a similar degree.


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}

# Plot the network
plot(g1)

# Convert the gender attribute into a numeric value
values <- as.numeric(factor(V(g1)$gender))

# Calculate the assortativity of the network based on gender
assortativity(g1, values)

# Calculate the assortativity degree of the network
assortativity.degree(g1, directed = FALSE)


```



# Using randomizations to assess assortativity

In this exercise you will determine how likely the observed
assortativity in the friendship network is given the genders of
vertices by performing a randomization procedure. You will randomly
permute the gender of vertices in the network 1000 times and recalculate
the assortativity for each random network.

```{r}

# Calculate the observed assortativity
observed.assortativity <- assortativity(g1, values)

# Calculate the assortativity of the network randomizing the gender attribute 1000 times
results <- vector('list', 1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
  results[[i]] <- assortativity(g1, sample(values))
}

# Plot the distribution of assortativity values and add a red vertical line at the original observed value
hist(unlist(results))

abline(v = observed.assortativity, col = "red", lty = 3, lwd=2)


```


# Reciprocity

The reciprocity of a directed network reflects the proportion of 
edges that are symmetrical. That is, the proportion of outgoing edges
that also have an incoming edge. It is commonly used to determine how
inter-connected directed networks are. An example of a such a network
may be grooming exchanges in chimpanzees. Certain chimps may groom another
but do not get groomed by that individual, whereas other chimps may both 
groom each other and so would have a reciprocal tie.

```{r}


# Make a plot of the chimp grooming network
# plot(g,
#      edge.color = "black",
#      edge.arrow.size = 0.3,
#      edge.arrow.width = 0.5)
# 
# # Calculate the reciprocity of the graph
# reciprocity(g)

```

## What does assortativity measure 

- How likely vertices are to connect to others that share some attribute in common.


# Fast-greedy community detection
The first community detection method you will try is fast-greedy community 
detection. You will use the Zachary Karate Club network. This social network
contains 34 club members and 78 edges. Each edge indicates that those two 
club members interacted outside the karate club as well as at the club. 
Using this network you will determine how many sub-communities the network
has and which club members belong to which subgroups. You will also plot
the networks by community membership.


```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=15}
# Perform fast-greedy community detection on network graph
kc = fastgreedy.community(g)

# Determine sizes of each community
sizes(kc)

# Determine which individuals belong to which community
membership(kc)

# Plot the community structure of the network
plot(kc, g)

```

# Edge-betweenness community detection
An alternative community detection method is edge-betweenness.
In this exercise you will repeat the community detection of 
the karate club using this method and compare the results 
visually to the fast-greedy method.



```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=14}
# Perform edge-betweenness community detection on network graph
gc = edge.betweenness.community(g)

# Determine sizes of each community
sizes(gc)

# Plot community networks determined by fast-greedy and edge-betweenness methods side-by-side
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) 
plot(kc, g)
plot(gc, g)


```



# Interactive networks with threejs

In this course you have exclusively used igraph to make
basic static network plots. There are many packages available to 
make network plots. One very useful one is threejs which allows
you to make interactive network visualizations. This package also 
integrates seamlessly with igraph. In this exercise you will make a
basic interactive network plot of the karate club network using the
threejs package. Once you have produced the visualization be sure to 
move the network around with your mouse. You should be able to scroll 
in and out of the network as well as rotate the network.


```{r}
library(igraph)
library(threejs)

# Set a vertex attribute called 'color' to 'dodgerblue' 
g1 <- set_vertex_attr(g1, "color", value = "dodgerblue")

# Redraw the graph and make the vertex size 1
graphjs(g1, vertex.size = 1)

```


# Sizing vertices in threejs

As with all network visualizations it is often worth adjusting the 
size of vertices to illustrate their relative importance. This is 
also straightforward in threejs. In this exercise you will create 
an interactive threejs plot of the karate club network and size 
vertices based on their relative eigenvector centrality.


```{r}
# Create numerical vector of vertex eigenvector centralities 
# Create numerical vector of vertex eigenvector centralities 
# ec <- as.numeric(eigen_centrality(g)$vector )
# 
# # Create new vector 'v' that is equal to the square-root of 'ec' multiplied by 5
# v <- 5*sqrt(ec)
# 
# # Plot threejs plot of graph setting vertex size to v
# graphjs(g, vertex.size = v)

```


# 3D community network graph
Finally in this exercise you will create an interactive
threejs plot with the vertices based on their community
membership as produced by the fast-greedy community detection method.


```{r}
# Create an object 'i' containin the memberships of the fast-greedy community detection
# i <-  membership(kc)
# 
# # Check the number of different communities
# sizes(kc)
# 
# # Add a color attribute to each vertex, setting the vertex color based on community membership
# g <- set_vertex_attr(g, "color", value = c("yellow", "blue", "red")[i])
# 
# # Plot the graph using threejs
# graphjs(g)

```
